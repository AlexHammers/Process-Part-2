An application that creates child processes and facilitates communication between the precesses.

Overloaded destructors that take parameters, or one destructor that takes a parameter with a switch statement inside.

The child needs to send a signal to the parent so it knows it's closing. The child would need to sleep right before it closes to give the parent time to read from the child's write.
